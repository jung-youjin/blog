# Differential Ampliferëž€?

A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages but suppresses any voltage common to the two inputs. It is an analog circuit with two inputs `Vin-` and `Vin+` and one output `Vout`, in which the output is ideally proportional to the difference between the two voltages:

`Vout=A(Vin+ - Vin-)`
where `A` is the gain of the amplifier.

Single amplifiers are usually implemented by either adding the appropriate feedback resistors to a standard op-amp, or with a dedicated integrated circuit containing internal feedback resistors. It is also a common sub-component of larger integrated circuits handling analog signals.
