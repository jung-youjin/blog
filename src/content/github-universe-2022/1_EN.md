This is a kick-off post to start the series on my trip to GitHub Universe! Though the tweet above is in Korean, I would like to jot down about the precious visiting experience to GitHub Universe 2022 on this blog. I was able to visit the conference due to the GitHub Campus Expert program that I've been working hard on since mid 2021.

<br>

Around 12 students were selected globally to visit the huge event called GitHub Universe at SF, including myself with great luck and thanks to my hard work, effort that I have put into embracing various communities. ❤ Even now my trip feels like a dream though it's been around a month since my visit, it was an unforgettable experience. Also, it means alot to me that I feel like it is a huge gift to celebrate wrapping up my undergraduate college days. So, I tried my best to make the best out of this trip by making precious memories and learning from it.

<br/>

<br>

To the readers especially student/developers, I would love to deliver the impression and excitement that I experienced throughout the trip. And also, through this series of posts, I would also like to introduce what I expereienced, learnt, felt during the GitHub Universe 2022 event which is one of the great benefits that GitHub Campus Expert offers. 😁
